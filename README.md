# Bridging OOD Generalization and Detection: A Graph-Theoretic View

This is the source code accompanying the NeurIPS 2024 paper of [Bridging OOD Generalization and Detection: A Graph-Theoretic View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18205)  by Han Wang, Yixuan Li.

## Environment Preparation
You can set up the environment by running the following commands:
```bash
conda create --name graph_ood python==3.9.17
conda activate graph_ood
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Preparation
Download the dataset to the folder `./data`

Here are the links for the semantic OOD datasets used in this paper: [SVHN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/), [Textures](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/dtd/), [Places365](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/download.html), [LSUN](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fhtsw1m3qxlwj6h/LSUN.tar.gz), [LSUN-R](https://www.dropbox.com/s/moqh2wh8696c3yl/LSUN_resize.tar.gz), and [iSUN](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ssz7qxfqae0cca5/iSUN.tar.gz). We refer readers to these links [Scone](https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/scone) and [Robustness](https://github.com/hendrycks/robustness) to download the covariate OOD datasets.

For large-scale experiments, we use iNaturalist as the semantic OOD dataset. The dataset can be downloaded via the following link:
```bash
wget http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~huangrui/imagenet_ood_dataset/iNaturalist.tar.gz
```

## Demo
To pretrain the model (e.g., using the CIFAR-10-C as the covariate OOD dataset and SVHN as the semantic OOD dataset), you can modify the variable `checkpoints_dir` in the `./CIFAR/run_pt.sh`, and run the following command:
```bash
sh run_pt.sh graph_ood cifar10 svhn svhn
```
pi_1 is set to 0.5 and pi_2 is set to 0.1 as default. See the `run_pt.sh` for more details and options.

To finetune the model, you can modify the variable `load_pretrained` in the `./CIFAR/run_ft.sh` and run the following command:
```bash
sh run_ft.sh graph_ood cifar10 svhn svhn
```

## Checkpoints
We also provide some checkpoints during the pretraining process, please see `./CIFAR/snapshots`.
